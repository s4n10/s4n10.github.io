                        <h4> Introduction,</h4>
                        <p>
                            The greatest progress in greening the UK has been made in usage and the production of
                            electricity.
                            Coal generation has been largely eradicated, as has oil, to be replaced with gas, wind power
                            and bioenergy.
                            Throughout the UK Homes and businesses are moving into the use of more and more energy
                            efficient products and implementations.

                            However the looking at the motorised transport,
                            it does not seem to be getting any greener continuing to pump out nearly as much
                            climate-harming pollution as it did three decades ago.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) 2019 car registrations
                            report,
                            Sales of electric cars in the UK have risen by 34% since last year.
                            While the electric car sales in china were increased by 154%, however the 34% increase is a
                            significant change
                            from the 11% of the sales increase noted in the year of 2017 to 2018.

                            An analysis of the latest global sales of electric vehicles found that nearly half the
                            vehicles registered in Norway in the first three months of 2018
                            were electric (48%). With china leading the electric car race, its important to note how the
                            sales keep on increasing over the years,
                            the chart below provides a representation of global electric car sales of a few leading

                            “China and Norway are exceptional in e-mobility. The lead market remains China,

                            the electric car market in europe by heavy numbers.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Housing the worlds largest public garage for electric cars, Norway is the largest
                            European market for both the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. Norway’s power grid
                            is exclusively dependant on its hydro power resource. Nearly a third of all new cars
                            sold in the country this year will be a plug-in model – either fully electric or a
                            hybrid – and experts expect that share to rise to as much as 40% next year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the main reasons for this development in norway, is the backing of the
                            Norwegian government offering generous incentives and perks for owning an electric
                            car. Consumers do not have to pay import tax and VAT on plug-in cars, saving
                            thousands of pounds off the upfront cost. Running costs are lower because
                            electricity is cheaper than petrol and diesel, while road tax is reduced – and
                            ultimately dropping to zero next year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another reason is that it Electric car owners do not pay the road tolls, ferry fees
                            and city emissions charges that other Norwegians face. Moreover, they can park for
                            free and bypass traffic by driving in some bus lanes.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking at the other countries and where the UK stand right now it needs to be clear
                            that, Introducing electric cars to the market might need to be done sooner than
                            expected with the ever rising pollution levels and to keep up with the global
                            adaptation of electric cars. Taking norway as a example it needs to be understood
                            that drastic changes like this must be introduced with major support from the
                            government.

                        <p>
                            its very clear that even-though diesel sales have started to show a decline from the
                            year 2016, there is certainly an upward trend in the sales of the petrol cars.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If petrol and diesel were temporary taken out of the graph for a moment<i>(The lines
                                can be removed by clicking on the color on the legend representing of each of

                            It is clear that Hybrid cars have been gaining popularity over its lifetime, mainly
                            due to the fuel efficiency, however hybrid vehicles still require some kind of a
                            fuel source to function continuously. Therefore, the increasing trend line in the
                            hybrid sales may not be the best thing to help the country to plan for a full
                            electric future by 2030. However promoting plug-in electric cars may immensely
                            benefit the cause , by making the fuel to electric transition much more easier for
                            the consumers. Allowing them to prepare for the stop and charge lifestyle.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even though the government had introduced many generous incentives and other kinds
                            of facilities to promote the electric car use, the popularity does not seem to be
                            getting any better, not even nearly close to norway or china.

                            garages, which would be ideal for a home charging station where consumers can charge
                            their cars overnight make sure their cars are ready to go the next day. The problem
                            arises when targeting the rest of the consumers, according to a report published by
                            the ONS (Percentage of households with cars by income group, tenure and household)
                            78% of the surveyed houses had one or more car(s) registered to each house. Which
                            means nearly almost all the houses have a car registered to its address.

                            The most common form of parking has been the use of a garage although, overtime the
                            proportion of homes with a garage has steadily decreased, this is yet another
                            contributing cause for the infrastructure failure when introducing electric cars.
                            When more and more people are converting their garages to living spaces, they are
                            forced to park outside the street or use a parking facility. With very limited
                            charging points available all around, in terms of a using an electric car is just
                            not feasible .

                        near enough to satisfy or to convince a person to go ahead with an electric car purchase,
                        according a analysis carried out by the BBC, to Out of 385 authorities surveyed, only three
                        had 100 or more charging locations. Milton Keynes was found to be leading the way with 138,
                        followed by Westminster with 131 and Cornwall with 115. Overall, two thirds of local
                        authorities were found to have 20 or fewer. Only one charging location was identified in
                        Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly, North Dorset and Hinckley and Bosworth.

                        In order to provide a smooth transition, the charging network must be widespread and more
                        reliable, since lack of charging points happens to be one of the main reasons why consumers
                        are afraid or not wanting to move to an electric vehicle. Also, with the phasing out of the
                        petrol and diesel cars it needs to understood that there are over 18.5million Petrol cars
                        and 12.4 million diesel cars on the UK roads today. Therefore during the upcoming years the
                        electric charging point infrastructure in the UK must be ready to facilitate the massive
                        transition of petrol and diesel vehicles to full-electric. </p>
